- [x] Add "ownership" to files and folders
- [x] Upload files to the right folder

- [x] Allow files that aren't images to be uploaded
- [] Real homepage + onboarding (won't have root folder during onboarding. handle that.)
- [x] Add deletion
- [x] Make sure sort order is consistent
- [] Include fileKey in schema -- then migrate instead of overriding
  -- But fileKey comes from uploadthing, not singlestore db. so how do we get them into singlestore?
